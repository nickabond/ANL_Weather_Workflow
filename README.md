ANL_Weather_Workflow
====================

The purpose of the code within this repository is to make strides within a cloud-based sensor project.
As science shifts from a hands on interaction to an observational one, there must be a structure in 
place to ensure a steady and reliable workflow when computations are to be done in the cloud. The 
scripts present within this repository are intended for that exact purpose.
